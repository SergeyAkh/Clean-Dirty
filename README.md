# Clean-Dirty plates images classification.

Here is breaf approach to accomplish the task of classification clead and dirty images of plates from Kaggle competition. <br />

I used a combination of transfer learning and active learning to classify images of clean and dirty plates from a Kaggle competition. The process involved several key steps:
<br />
1. Preprocessing: I removed backgrounds and applied various image transformation techniques to augment the training set.
<br />
2. Model Training: After training the neural network, I made predictions on the test set. I labeled the images based on the assumption that dirty images should have a probability of being classified as dirty greater than or equal to 0.99, while clean images should have a probability less than or equal to 0.01.
<br />
3. Pseudo-Labeling: This approach resulted in a new pseudo-labeled dataset for further training.
<br />
4. Second Training: I trained the model again with the updated dataset and then made predictions on the test set once more, creating a submission file.
<br />
5. Performance: The final score I achieved was 0.85.

Now, Iâ€™m excited to test the model on real photos to see how it performs in practical scenarios!
